This is a page where I would like to maintain a list of Codecademy projects I do, just
to be able to remember and show my javascript, html and css skills. 

At the beginning, projects won't be very complex, but I hope they'll be getting more
and more complex over time. Feel free to post any comment or send a link to your own
Codecademy projects. They have an [APIs track](www.codecademy.com/tracks/apis) where
you can practice codig for well know API's (youtube, soundtrack, twilio).

Let's start, from more recent to older projects:

## [A simple drawing tool](http://j.mp/V9SP9b)

<!-- 445x416 -->
[{% img left /images/codecademy/simple-drawing-tool.png 250 233 'Simple drawing tool' %}](http://j.mp/V9SP9b)

*Created in February, 2013*

In this project, I created a small area where you can draw simple shapes, like squares,
circles and triangles. You also can choose between four colors to fill these shapes.

It is a very simple drawing tool, but you will feel the power of the HTML canvas element
with a bit of javascript.

## [Palindrome phrase validation](http://j.mp/WwwSM1)

<!-- 599x206 -->
[{% img right /images/codecademy/palindrome-phrase-validation.png 300 103 'Palindrome phrase validation' %}](http://j.mp/WwwSM1)

*Created in January, 2013*

In this project, I created a simple web form to validate if a word or phrase entered 
can be considered as a palindrome. It is really simple, but I didn't want to write an
email validation form, that can be done by html5.

## [Icon editor](http://j.mp/NS39tI)

<!-- 908x562 -->
[{% img left /images/codecademy/icon-editor.png 301 187 'Icon editor' %}](http://j.mp/NS39tI)

*Created in 2012*

This is my very first public project at Codecademy. It allows you to *draw* a 16x16 px
icon using a few colors. 

It is not a professional tool, so please, don't be too much rude with me, it's only a
small pet project, I'm learning.
