## 2 - breaking the ice and getting the conversation going

- how do you actually start a conversation :
1.1. risk versus rejection
1.2. ritual questions
1.3. listen for free information
1.4. seek inforamtion (follow-up questions)
1.5. self-disclosure (reveal your free information)
- closed-ended Vs open-ended questions
- introduce yourself to people regularly and begin to share your ideas, feelings, opinions, and experiences. And
after saying hello, seek out other people's thoughts, views, interestss, and knowledge.
- Break the ice with a compliement or comment followed by a *ritual question*
- break the ice by noticing osmething that the person is carrying, ask a ritual question based on the object
- break the ice by making a comment or ask a question based on the situation
- the longer you wait to make an introudciont the  more uncomfortable people get
- *Closed-ended* questions require only a yes or a no
- they are more effective when they are followed by an *open-ended* question
- *free information* es informacion que damos voluntariamente
- Do smalltalk -> most conversations that do not go through the 'ritual' phases rarely proceed to deeper and more meaningful levels. That's why
smalltalk is so important
- Don't think (about what to say next), just listen, listen for *key words*, facts, opinions, feeling, and most of all, *free information*
- *iceber statement* is a comment or a iece of free informaion where 90% is under the surface waiting to be asked about
- Once you've broken the ice, asked a few ritual questiosn, used active listening, THEN is time to seek further information 
based on the free informatino you learned
- self-disclose free information about you
- if you desire meaningful convewrsations, be prepared to reveal some of your history and what is important to you

1.5. change topics using free informatino
1.6. seek out common interests and experiences

- Second hang up : 'I can read a person like a book', people don't like being stereotyped, in resposne, they may stereotype you, and the communication channel closes
- 'It doesnt matter to me' : this attitude tells about noninvolvement, indifference, boredom or even insincerity
- you're destined to a life of frustation and disappointment if you only respond to the world around you based on *what people think about me?*
- 4th hang up : 'tell me something I dont know', you're giving ghe message the other person's ideas and feelings dont matter to you

## 7 - closing converstions tactfully

- there are natural pauses between sentences and its wise to bring your converstioan to a close at those tiems
- handling a complainer : after listening for free information and details of the problem, ask a few yes/no or closed-ended questions to break the flow of complaints and to allow you to direct the conversatoin to a conclusion
- para solucionar los problemas de los amigos, en lugar de darlses consejos, pídeles que te cuenten sus opciones
- para quitarte de enmedio a vendedores, si no acpetan un *no* por resupesta repite como un disco rallado *no estoy interesado*
