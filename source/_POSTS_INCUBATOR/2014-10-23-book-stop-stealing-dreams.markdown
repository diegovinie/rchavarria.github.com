Notas acerca del libro 'Stop stealing dreams', de Seth Godin

- large-scale education was not developed to motivate kids or to create scholars, fue para crear adultos sumisos, trabajadores para líneas de montaje en las fábricas
- if you do ajob where someone tells you exactly what to do, he will find someone cheaper than you to do it
- what's school for?
1. to create a society that's culturally coordinated -> but TV wins
2. to further science and knowledge and pursue information for its own sake -> luego asociamos leer libros con los exámenes, poca gente lee por el placer de leer y aprender
3. to enhance civilization while giving people the tools to make informed decisions -> we failed at raise the standards for rational thought, skeptical investigation, and useful financial decision making
4. to train people to become productive workers (en este si que lo hemos petado)
- si la escuela fue creada para 'fabricar' fuerza de trabajo, y ya no necesitamos fuerza de trabajo, ¿para qué invertir en mejorar la escuela? cambiémosla
- in 1914, a professor in Kansas invented the multiple-choice test. he said: 'this is a test of lower order thinking (no necesitas saber las cosas para responder) for the lower orders (para los ignorantes)
- esos exámenes siguen vigentes, no porque funciones, but it's easy and efficient way to keep the mass production of students moving forward.
- shools industrial, scaled-up, measurable structure means that fear must be used to keep the masses in line (fear destrois passion)
- we can teach people to make commitments, overcome fear, deal transparently, inititate and plan a course, desire lifelong learning, express themselves and innovate. Pero en lugar de eso, hemos hecho olvidar bravery, creativity and initiative
- dreamers in schools are dangerous, they are hard to fit into existing systgems
- learning is something you choose to do
- he aquí 12 formas en las que la escuela puede ser reformada:
1. homework during the day, lectures at night
2. open book, open note, all the time
3. access to any course, anywhere in the world
4. precise, focused instruction instead of mass, generalized instruction
5. the end of multiple-choice exams
6. experience instead of test scores as a measure of achievement
7. the end of compliance as an outcome
8. cooperation instead of isolation
9. amplification of outlying sudents, teachers, and ideas
10. transformation of the role of the teacher
11. lifelong learning, earlier work
12. death o fthe nearly famous college
- that's the new job of school, not to hand a map to those willing to follow it, but to inclucate leadership and restlessness into a new generation
- the world changed first, now it's time for school to follow along
- nowadays, reputation is worth more than test scores. access to data means that data isn't the valuable part, the processin is
- en lugar de aislar estudiantes, deberiamos conectarlos : trabajo en grupo, clases intractivas, ...
- transparency is missing, in search of power, control and independence, administrators hide informaiton from teachers and vice-versa
- *connection economy* Students have the ability to easily do outside resarch and to discover that the teacher (or her textbook) is just plain wrong.
- School is a kind of *contract of adhesion*, that means, a take-it-or-leave-it mass deal. There is no individual negotiation possible.
- we don't ask students to decide to participate, we assume the contract of adhesion
- great doctors are great because they made the choice
- the shortcut for achieving the school goal (make compliant citizens) is **fear**. do this or we'll tell your parents, be suspended, ...
- there really are only two tools available to the educator: fear and passion
- the problem is that individual passion is hard to scale
- la escuela enseña cosas que se dan por sentadas, que no admiten dudas. pero la nueva deberia enseñar duda razonable, ucestionarse científicamente las cosas
- John Stuart Mill: it's better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied
- Bravery in school is pushined, not rewarded
- school, no surprise, is focused on crating hourly workers. it downplays group work, breaks tasks into the smallest possible measurable units, does nothing to coordinate teaching, isolates teachres into departments. It measure individual level
- every one of those behaviors is a mirror of what hapens in the factory in 1937
- scarce skills combinde with even scarcer attitudes almost always lead to low unemployment and high wages
- Judgement, skill, and attitude are the new replacements for obedience
- It used to be simple: the teacher was teh cop, the lecturer, the source of answers, and the gatekeeper to resources. We don't need a human being standing next to us to lecture us on how to find the saquare root of a number or sharpen an axe. What we do need is someone to persuade us that we want to learn those things
- competent people solve a problem the same way, every time
- competence is the enemy of change
- incompetent worker is one who will break the rules and find me something no one else can
- we're entering a revolution of ideas while producing a generation that wants instructions instead
- the only barrier to learning, is now merely the decision to learn
- a surplus of obedient hourly workers leads to unemployment, not more factories. on the other hand, creative jobs lead to more creative jobs.
