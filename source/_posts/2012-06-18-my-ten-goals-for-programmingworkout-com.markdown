I don't remember exactly, but I think I arrived to <a href="http://programmingworkout.com">programmingworkout.com</a> web through one person I follow on twitter (but I can't remember who, sorry). The idea looked to me very interesting, and I decided just to sign in. I completely forgot about it, but last week I received an email from Michal Taszycki (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/mehowte">@mehowte</a>).

In this email, Michal challenges me (and 500 others) to complete three tasks:
<ol>
	<li>Collect at least 10 goals: write down anything you want to achieve</li>
	<li>Think about a vision: imagine a vision of your future self</li>
	<li>Connect with others: friend/follow/meet at least three strangers</li>
</ol>

<!-- more -->

So, to complete my first task, here there are the list of my ten goals I want to achieve in a near future. Some of them are not very specific or follow the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">SMART</a> principles, but I have something to start with.

<ol>
	<li>Master command line tools (specially, *nix command line)</li>
	<li>Learn some shell scripting language: windows shell, unix shell, awk, whatever</li>
	<li>Proficiency with type writting</li>
	<li>Know more IDE shortcuts (I use eclipse in my daily basis)</li>
	<li>Learn more about design patterns</li>
	<li>Regular expressions</li>
	<li>Practice groovy/grails programming language</li>
	<li>OOP principles (<a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod">SOLID</a>, pdf <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/Principles_and_Patterns.pdf">summary</a>)</li>
	<li>Practice TDD</li>
	<li>Learn how to use <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a></li>
</ol>

The second task is to imagine a vision of my future self. I didn't think about it too much, so I don't have a clear idea. It should be something like being a good professional developer, contributing to open source projects, participating in an excelent team of professionals, or something related. But, it is still too vague to describe it.
