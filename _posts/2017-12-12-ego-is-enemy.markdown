### Por qué lo he leído

Pues la verdad es que no sé muy bien por qué. Podría entrar en la categoría de libros
de autoayuda, pero una vez leído siento que el libro no está dirigido a personas
como yo. Habla mucho de las personas de éxito y demás, y yo me considero más una
persona normal, nada de un famosete o algo así.

Vi que el libro lo recomendaba [Derek Sivers], que me parece razón suficiente, y
quizá el autor lo haya oído por ahí, por el podcast de Tim Ferris, no sé, me
suena de algo. Pero sobretodo por la recomendación.

### El prólogo doloroso

El ego es el enemigo, y el obstáculo es el camino

### Introducción

El ego siempre estuvo ahí. Y ahora está envalentonado. Allá donde estés, el ego está ahí también.

En un momento cualquiera de la vida, la gente se encuentra en alguna de estas
fases:

1. Aspirando a algo más
2. Ha alcanzado el éxito
3. Ha fracasado

### Aspirar

Da lo mismo a lo que aspires, el ego es tu enemigo

En esta fase, debes practicar verte a tí mismo con un poco de distancia, cultivando
la habilidad de salir de tu propia mente. El desapego es un antídoto natural para
el ego. Es fácil estar emocionalmente enamorado de tu propio trabajo. Cualquira
puede hacerlo. Lo que es raro no es el talento natural, las habilidades o incluso
la confianza. Lo que es raro es la humildad, la diligencia y la consciencia de 
sí mismo.

### Hablar, hablar, hablar

It’s a temptation that exists for everyone—for talk and hype to replace action.
Blank spaces, begging to be filled in with thoughts, with photos, with stories. With what we’re going to do,
espacios en blanco donde escribir lo que vamos a hacer. no lo que hacemos o hemos hecho

Even a child knows how to gossip and chatter. Most people are decent at hype and sales. So what is scarce and rare? Silence.

no hables tanto . ni siquiera a ti mismo  y haz el trabajo duro. lucha contra las ganas de parar para hablar
Success requires a full 100 percent of our effort, and talk flitters part of that effort away before we can use it.
TO BE OR TO DO?
Having authority is not the same as being an authority. Having the right and being right are not the same either. Being promoted doesn’t necessarily mean you’re doing good work and it doesn’t mean you are worthy of promotion (they call it failing upward in such bureaucracies). Impressing people is utterly different from being truly impressive.
Boyd puts in front of us comes down to purpose. What is your purpose? What are you here to do? Because purpose helps you answer the question “To be or to do?“

BECOME A STUDENT
The power of being a student is not just that it is an extended period of instruction, it also places the ego and ambition in someone else’s hands.

plus, minus, and equal. Each fighter, to become great, he said, needs to have someone better that they can learn from, someone lesser who they can teach, and someone equal that they can challenge themselves against.

We not only need to take this harsh feedback, but actively solicit it, labor to seek out the negative precisely when our friends and family and brain are telling us that we’re doing great.
DON’T BE PASSIONATE

Passion typically masks a weakness. Its breathlessness and impetuousness and franticness are poor substitutes for discipline, for mastery, for strength and purpose and perseverance.
en lufar de pasion necesitamos disciplina. objetivos. proposito. perseverancia...
Leave passion for the amateurs. Make it about what you feel you must do and say, not what you care about and wish to be.
FOLLOW THE CANVAS STRATEGY
Find canvases for other people to paint on. Be an anteambulo. Clear the path for the people above you and you will eventually create a path for yourself.
That’s what the canvas strategy is about—helping yourself by helping others.

RESTRAIN YOURSELF
Getting angry, getting emotional, losing restraint is a recipe for failure in

THE DANGER OF EARLY PRIDE

pride—even in real accomplishments—is a distraction and a deluder.
Our ability to learn, to adapt, to be flexible, to build relationships, all of this is dulled by pride.
The question to ask, when you feel pride, then, is this: What am I missing right now that a more humble person might see?
WORK, WORK, WORK

Is it ten thousand hours or twenty thousand hours to mastery?
There is no end zone.

SUCCESS
Success is intoxicating, yet to sustain it requires sobriety. We can’t keep learning if we think we already know everything.

It takes a special kind of humility to grasp that you know less, even as you know and grasp more and more.

DON’T TELL YOURSELF A STORY
you doubted yourself? Crafting stories out of past events is a very human impulse. It’s also dangerous and untrue. Writing our own narrative leads to arrogance.

al alcanzar el exito. no debemos montar una granhistoria. no la hay. solo trabajo duro
we might think that success in the future is just the natural next part of the story—when really it’s rooted in work, creativity, persistence, and luck.
Instead of pretending that we are living some great story, we must remain focused on the execution—and on executing with excellence.

All of us waste precious life doing things we don’t like, to prove ourselves to people we don’t respect, and to get things we don’t want. Why
Ego leads to envy
The farther you travel down that path of accomplishment, whatever it may be, the more often you meet other successful people who make you feel insignificant.
it’s not about beating the other guy. It’s not about having more than the others.
ENTITLEMENT, CONTROL, AND PARANOIA

we begin to overestimate our own power.
It’s human to think that since it’s been done once—that the world was changed in some big or small way—that there is now a magical power in our possession.
MANAGING YOURSELF
Most of us are not the president, or even president of a company, but in moving up the ladder in life, the system and work habits that got us where we are won’t necessarily keep us there.
As you become successful in your own field, your responsibilities may begin to change. Days become less and less about doing and more and more about making decisions.
Such is the nature of leadership.
BEWARE THE DISEASE OF ME
Ego needs honors in order to be validated. Confidence, on the other hand, is able to wait and focus on
Ego needs honors in order to be validated. Confidence, on the other hand, is able to wait and focus on the task at hand regardless of external recognition.

Yes, we are small. We are also a piece of this great universe and a process.
MAINTAIN
MAINTAIN YOUR SOBRIETY
Most successful people are people you’ve never heard of. They want it that way. It keeps them sober. It helps them do their jobs.

instead of taking what we have for granted, we’d be better to spend our time preparing for the shifts of fate that inevitably occur in life. That is, adversity, difficulty, failure.

FAILURE
chance of failure or setbacks. Bill Walsh says, “Almost always, your road to victory goes through a place called ‘failure.’” In order to taste success again, we’ve got to understand what led to this moment (or these years) of difficulty, what went wrong and why. We must deal with the situation in order to move past it. We’ll need to accept it and to push through it.

We must deal with the situation in order to move past it. We’ll need to accept it and to push through it.
When we face difficulty, particularly public difficulty (doubters, scandals, losses), our friend the ego will show its true colors. Absorbing the negative feedback, ego says: I knew you couldn’t do it. Why did you ever try? It claims: This isn’t worth it. This isn’t fair. This is somebody else’s problem. Why don’t you come up with a good excuse and wash your hands of this?
The only way out is through.
la unic orma de salir de la adversidad es atravesarla
ALIVE TIME OR DEAD TIME?
Every moment of failure, every moment or situation that we did not deliberately choose or control, presents this choice: Alive time. Dead time.
When injustice or the capriciousness of fate are inflicted on someone, the normal reaction is to yell, to fight back, to resist. You know the feeling: I don’t want this. I want ______. I want it my way. This is shortsighted.
when we fail or get ourselves into trouble. Lacking the ability to examine ourselves, we reinvest our energy into exactly the patterns of behavior that caused our problems to begin with.

If ego holds sway, we’ll accept nothing less than full appreciation.
Will we work hard for something that can be taken away from us? Will we invest time and energy even if an outcome is not guaranteed? With the right motives we’re willing to proceed. With ego, we’re not.

Does everyone take advantage of that opportunity? Of course not. Ego often causes the crash and then blocks us from improving.
Face the symptoms. Cure the disease. Ego makes it so hard—it’s easier to delay, to double down,
But change begins by hearing the criticism and the words of the people around you.

You have to be able to see the bigger picture. But when ego is in control, who can?

MAINTAIN YOUR OWN SCORECARD
middle.”) This is characteristic of how great people think. It’s not that they find failure in every success. They just hold themselves to a standard that exceeds what society might consider to be objective success. Because of that, they don’t much care what other people think; they care whether they meet their own standards.

ALWAYS LOVE

In the Internet age, we call this the Streisand effect
Attempting to destroy something out of hate or ego often ensures that it will be preserved and disseminated forever.
to quote his lyrics, “smile[d] its blacktooth grin.” This obsession with the past, with something that someone did or how things should have been, as much as it hurts, is ego embodied. Everyone else has moved on, but you can’t, because you can’t see anything but your own way.

Does this get us any closer to where we want to be? No.
FOR EVERYTHING THAT COMES NEXT, EGO IS THE ENEMY . . .
the old Celtic saying tells us, “See much, study much, suffer much, that is the path to wisdom.”
Aspiration leads to success (and adversity). Success creates its own adversity (and, hopefully, new ambitions). And adversity leads to aspiration and more success. It’s an endless loop.
EPILOGUE
what is most obvious but most ignored is that perfecting the personal regularly leads to success as a professional, but rarely the other way around.
